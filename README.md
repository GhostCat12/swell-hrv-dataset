# SWELL Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Dataset

The dataset can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qiriro/swell-heart-rate-variability-hrv).

This HRV dataset was originally from the multimodal SWELL knowledge work (SWELL-KW) dataset from a study focussing on stress response. 

The experiment was conducted on 25 individuals carrying out typical office work who were put through three working conditions. 
1. No stress (control) environment: Subjects can work on a task without distractions or imposed time limits. 
2. Time pressure: Subjects were made aware of a time limit (2/3 of the average time taken in environment 1)
3. Interruption: Subjects were interrupted 8 times by emails; some were relevant, actionable requests for the current task, and others were irrelevant.
